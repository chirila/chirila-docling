  {"id":"ogrady1998b","abstract":"This tabular display of 25 Proto-Pama-Nyungan stems in *j- and their reflexes represents a small part of a \"Top Down\" type of study embracing ten of the thirteen initial consonants (i.e., all but velars, under which rubric 1,561 putative cognate sets are presented in Fitzgerald 1997a). Data from sixty languages are used; of these, about 30 figure prominently in the comparisons. Some cognates span the entire width of the Australian continent. The uncovering of such cognates-at-a-distance throws further useful light on the vast Pama-Nyungan language family, which occupied seven-eighths of the area of Australia. The degree of plausibility of each putative cognate is quantified on a scale from zero to five, in keeping, for example, with the Kluge etymological dictionary of German, which qualifies many etymologies with vielleicht \"perhaps,\" unklar \"unclear,\" and so forth. The work is conducted in the belief, contra Heath (1994), that the reconstructible lexicon of Proto-Pama-Nyungan will ultimately amount not to a mere few dozen, but rather to several thousand. This accords with Hale's (pers. comm., 1961) assertion that Pama-Nyungan is the largest coherent genetic linguistic construct in Australia. The tabulation of the 25 cognate sets is preceded by a discussion of a number of problems on the phonological, morphological, and semantic levels that arise in Pama-Nyungan comparative work. Interestingly, a number of these problems, such as sporadic word-initial nasal gradation, sporadic medial prenasalization, and sporadic vowel fronting, have parallels in Austronesian.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2013,6,6]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Grady","given":"Geoff N."}],"citation-key":"ogrady1998b","container-title":"Oceanic Linguistics","container-title-short":"Oceanic Linguistics","DOI":"10.2307/3623409","ISSN":"0029-8115","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[1998,12,1]]},"license":"Copyright © 1998 University of Hawai'i Press","note":"ArticleType: research-article / Full publication date: Dec., 1998 / Copyright © 1998 University of Hawai'i Press","page":"209-233","source":"JSTOR","title":"Toward a Proto-Pama-Nyungan Stem List, Part I: Sets J1-J25","title-short":"Toward a Proto-Pama-Nyungan Stem List, Part I","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3623409","volume":"37"},
  {"id":"pensalfini2003a","abstract":"This book is intended as a thorough description of the Jingulu language as spoken by the handful of speakers remaining in the Northern Territory ding the mid to late 1990s. The description is based on material which the author collected during three field trips from 1995 to late 1998. Chapter 1 focuses on the socio-historical context in which he language is spoken, including estimated of tradition area, number of speakers, and genetic and cultural affiliations. Chapter 2 is devoted to Jingulu phonology, from the phoneme inventory and phonotactics to a spectacular system of vowel harmony and some interesting facts on reduplication. Chapter 3 outlines the parts of speech of Jingulu as understood by the author, and argues for the particular labels and categories that the author assumes in following chapters. Chapter 4 discusses Jingulu syntax, from simple verbal and non-verbal predication to the encoding of dependent and conjoined clauses. Chapters 5 and 6 are expositions of the morphology of Jingulu nominal and verbal words respectively. Chapter 7 contains a few exemplary texts, glossed and translated into English. Through the grammar the author has preferred to provide more sentence examples rather than fewer (particular where the author was less than certain about the accuracy of his own description), to provide readers with a sense of what Jingulu sentences are actually like beyond what can be gleaned from prose description, and to provide future researchers with organised material with which to build their own hypotheses and analyses. This grammar contains no word list or dictionary. A separate Jingulu dictionary by the author is in preparation.","author":[{"family":"Pensalfini","given":"Rob"}],"citation-key":"pensalfini2003a","event-place":"Canberra","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"284","publisher":"Pacific Linguistics","publisher-place":"Canberra","source":"Google Books","title":"A Grammar of Jingulu, an Aboriginal Language of the Northern Territory","type":"book"},
